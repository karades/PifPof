# PifPof
Repository for my boxhead-like game.
# What is "PifPof"?
PifPof is temporary name of my project, which I created when I created Unity project.

This game is my try to recreate game called boxhead, which I was playing some time ago.

Idea is to create it as similar as possible, but with some extensions like different aiming, custom look, more maps.
Main difference may be with leveling up and perks for weapons, where in original we have combo meter, here it may be connectted to levels we passed.

# Where can I play it?
You can run current build on Itch.io in browser.
